    <h1>Authored</h1>

    <h2>Write your book, in your own voice.</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Authored</strong> helps you turn ideas into finished books.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you know what you want to say but struggle to organize it or keep going,
      Authored gives you a clear, steady process from outline to final manuscript.
    </p>

    <p>
      You work one chapter at a time, revise as needed, and keep your voice
      consistent from the first page to the last.
